# tanktool
Allows diep players to automate console commands in diep to optimize for each specific tank the player uses. Rust Port from https://github.com/Triballian/tanktool . Starting code I pulled from go playground https://play.golang.org/p/osbinz7DmN . Using https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard ToDo: I will need to make it detect if the program is already running. If it is do not run it again. This should keep you from running the program more than once at any time.
